## v3 – Playwright + JSON-LD + PDF Intelligence

### New Superpowers (Simple Terms)

| Feature | What It Does | Example Fix |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| **Playwright** | Opens websites **like a real browser**, waits for content to load | nazindia.org → now sees "1994" in JS-loaded div |
| **JSON-LD** | Reads **hidden machine-readable data** in `<script type="application/ld+json">` | Gets `foundingDate: "1994-01-01"` directly |
| **PDF Support** | Downloads and **reads text from PDF reports** | If "Annual Report 2023.pdf" says "Founded in 1994", we get it |

> Think of it like this:  
> **Playwright** = eyes that wait and see everything  
> **JSON-LD** = a secret note the website leaves for robots  
> **PDF** = opening a locked drawer where NGOs keep their real history
